Script to download videos from YouTube.
Make life easier when downloading videos to keep offline.

Did you mention OSS (Open Source Software)?
Here's my script that I've been using lately to download videos from youtube.

# The limitations are currently
- Download videos up to 720p in .mp4 format
- Sometimes some downloads may become unavailable due to overload

# Future plans for exciting features:
- Implement high quality .mp3 download (128/320kbps)
- Download multiple videos at the same time
- Include translations (anyone who can contribute will be great)

Suggestions are always welcome... Thanks guys!
